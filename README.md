## Features

### Planned Features
* The header will contain a sticky navigation bar. For unregistered users this will have 3 links which will direct you to the following pages; Browse, Log In & Sign Up. For registered users this will show links to the Browse and Watchlist page as well as a Log Out link.
* The mobile view will get rid of the navigation bar and instead have a navigation button. When clicking this button, the navigation links will appear vertically on the page. 
* The Home page will display information about the website and have a button linking to the Browse page.
* The Browse page will display Cryptocurrencies. Clicking on a Crypto will take you to another page displaying more information about it. Registered users will be able to submit, edit and delete their own comments.
* The Sign Up page will allow users to register to the website.
* The Log In page will allow registered users to log in to the website.
* The Watchlist page will allow registered users to create their own Watchlist of cryptocurrencies.
